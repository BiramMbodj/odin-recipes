This webpage is a collection of some delicious recipes that I found (even though I have yet to taste some of them) on the internet.

For now there is only three recipes:

1. The chickpea and coconut curry
2. The classic but unavoidable chocolate cake
3. The exotic cranberry sauce with orange juice

For each recipe I have detailed :

- [x] The prep time, cook time, and total time
- [x] All the necessary ingredients
- [x] The directions including all the steps you have to follow
